    # Winnow

Winnow is a concise, Python-based pipeline designed to **sift** relevant bibliographic references from extensive collections of `.bib` files. By parsing entries, optionally augmenting missing abstracts, and applying both keyword- and classifier-based filters, Winnow aims to curate a refined `.bib` file highlighting only the literature that truly matters to you.

## Project Status

This repository currently hosts only planning and design artifacts. No functional code is available yet. For detailed requirements and architecture, refer to documentation available under `docs`.

## Getting Started

Once the implementation phase begins, instructions for installing and running Winnow (e.g., via a command-line interface) will appear here.

## Contributing

Contributions, suggestions, and feedback are welcome. Feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request once the initial code is in place.
